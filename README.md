This example demonstrates a potential pitfall in VBScript when using the IsEmpty function.  The function doesn't differentiate between an uninitialized variable and a variable explicitly set to an empty string. This can cause errors if you require this distinction within your code. The bug.vbs file showcases the problem; bugSolution.vbs offers a robust solution that addresses this ambiguity.
